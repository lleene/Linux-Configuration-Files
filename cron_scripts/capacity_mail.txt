Cc: root

Dear user,

This is an automated message indicating that your personal folder on the file system is currently occupying a large amount of data. Note that we try to enforce a maximum quota of a 100GB per user.

Please help us with managing our shared file system by removing any unused simulation data or moving personal files to your desktop/personal storage. This would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Administration
